<p>Artificial intelligence should be transparent.
As large-scale machine learning systems exhibit
more emergent and unexpected behavior,
we need to know how they work.
And for people to have real agency
in this new era of computer science,
our understanding of large models must be
specific and concrete.
We must be able to explain behavior,
debug internal logic, and modify hidden
rules that govern choices.
We should be able to take apart
the pieces and put them back together, in different ways,
to make something new.
</p>
<p>As a PhD student in <a href="http://web.mit.edu/torralba/www/"
>Antonio Torralba's lab</a>, I develop techniques for
understanding the computations of deep neural networks.
I have found evidence that the
representations learned by deep networks can have a
simple underlying structure.
The focus of my research at MIT is therefore to
find ways to enhance and exploit this structure
to make deep networks more transparent.</p>
<p>I also have a long interest in the wider problem of making all
computer systems more programmable. I develop programming
interfaces, open standards, tools and libraries that make complex
systems easier to understand.

<a href="http://rewriting.csail.mit.edu/">Rewriting a Deep Generative Model.</a>
  Deep network training is a blind optimization procedure
  where programmers define objectives but not the solutions that emerge.
  In this paper we ask if deep networks can be created in different way:
  we ask if a user can directly rewrite the rules of a model.
<span class="more"></span>
<span class="extra">
  We develop a method and a
  user interface that allows simple visual editing of the rules of
  a GAN, and demonstrate direct editing of high-level rules in pretrained
  state-of-the-art StyleGANv2 models.  Our method finds connections
  between modern large network layers and the classic neural data structure
  of Optimal Linear Associative Memory, and shows that it is feasible
  for a person to directly edit the weights of a large model to change
  its behavior, without training againist a data set, by understanding
  the model's internal structure.

  >Understanding the Role of Individual Units in a Deep Neural Network.</a>
The causal role of individual units within a deep network can be
measured by directly changing those units and observing the impact.
<span class="more"></span>
<span class="extra">
  In this study, we unify and extend the netdissect and gandissect methods
  to compare and understand classifiers and generators.  Removing sets of
  units from a classifier reveals a sparse computational structure:
  we find that a small set of neurons is important
  for the accuracy of an individual classifier output class, and
  that neurons that are important for more classes also are more
  human-interpretable.

Most introductory courses on deep networks focus on how to train models, but it
is just as important to understand the structure and behavior of the models
after training is done.  By bringing current research in deep network
interpretation
to students, the SIDN course is designed to start filling that gap.

studies mode dropping by asking the inverse question:
how can we decompose and understand what a GAN <em>cannot</em> do?
<span class="more"></span>
<span class="extra">A core challenge faced by GANs is <em>mode dropping</em>
or <em>mode collapse</em>, which is the tendendency for a GAN generator to
focus on a few modes and omit other parts of the distribution.
State-of-the-art GANs apply training methods designed to reduce
mode collapse, but analyzing the phenomenon remains difficult for large
distributions: examination of output samples reveals what a GAN <em>can</em>
do, not what it <em>cannot</em> do.  So in this paper we
develop a pair of complementary methods for decomposing what GAN omits,
looking at segmentation statistics over a distribution, and also visualizing
omissions in specific instances by calculating inversions of a GAN generator.
Surprisingly, we find that a state-of-the-art GAN will sometimes cleanly
omit whole classes of objects from its output, hiding these omissions
by creating realistic instances without those objects.

applies <a href="http://gandissect.csail.mit.edu/">
GAN dissection</a> to the manipulation of user-provided real
photographs.  By encoding a scene into a representation that can
be rendered by a generator network derived from a GAN, a user
can manipulate photo semantics, painting objects such as doors,
windows, trees,
and domes.  The details of rendering objects in plausible
configurations is left to the network.
<span class="more"></span>
<span class="extra">
Our previous GAN dissection work showed how to manipulate random
synthetic images generated by an unconditional GAN.  To manipulate
a real photograph <em>X</em> instead,
the generator must be guided to reproduce the photograph faithfully.
While <a href="https://github.com/junyanz/iGAN">previous work</a>
has investigated finding the best input <em>z</em>
so that <em>G(z)&asymp;X</em>, we show that it is useful to also optimize
the parameters of <em>G</em> itself.  Even in cases where the GAN is not
capable of rendering the details of the user-provided photo, a nearby
GAN generator can be found that does. We
implemented our algorithm using an interactive painting app at

to change the behavior of a generator.
<span class="more"></span>
<span class="extra">
Here we ask whether the apparent
structure that we found in classifiers also appears in a setting with
no supervision from labels.  Strikingly, we find that a state-of-the-art
GAN trained to generate complex scenes will learn neurons that are
specific to types of objects in the scene, such as neurons for trees,
doors, windows, and rooftops.
The work shows how to find such neurons, and shows that by forcing
the neurons on and off, you can cause a generator to draw or remove
specific types of objects in a scene.

Network Dissection</a>
is a technique for quantifying and automatically
estimating the human interpretability (and interpretation) of units

<span class="more"></span>
<span class="extra">
Building upon a surprising
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6856">2014 finding by Bolei Zhou</a>,
network dissection defines a dictionary of 1197 human-labeled
visual concepts, each represented as a segmentation problem, then
it estimates interpretability by evaluating each hidden convolutional
unit as a solution to those problems.
I have used network dissection to reveal that representation space is
not isotropic: learned representations have an unusually high agreement
with human-labeled concepts that vanishes under a change in basis.
We gave an oral presentation about
the technique and the insights it provides at CVPR 2017.
